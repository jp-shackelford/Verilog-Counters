Desctiption:
	DE1_SoC.v is a template project for all other work on the DE1_SoC for this
	class. It sets up all the relevent inputs and outputs with the GPIO pins so
	that reassigning them will not be necessary in the future.
	
Inputs:
	CLOCK_50: The DE1_SoC board's internal system clock, running at 50MHz
	SW: The 10 switches that the DE1_SoC board has
	KEY: The 4 buttons that the DE1_SoC board has
	
Outputs:
	LEDR: The 10 LEDs that the DE1_SoC board has
	HEX0-HEX5: The six 7-segment displays that the DE1_SoC board has
